Package: mysql-router
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: route connections from MySQL clients to MySQL servers
 MySQL Router is part of InnoDB cluster, and is lightweight middleware that
 provides transparent routing between your application and back-end MySQL
 servers. It can be used for a wide variety of use cases, such as providing
 high availability and scalability by effectively routing database traffic to
 appropriate back-end MySQL servers. The pluggable architecture also enables
 developers to extend MySQL Router for custom use cases.
 .
 Since MySQL Router is clustering software and needs to be configured and
 managed across an entire cluster, packaging cannot manage it for you. This
 package supplies the binary build only, ready for manual configuration.
