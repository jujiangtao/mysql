Description: Reintroduce my_bool to fix numerous third-party ftbfs
 The my_bool symbol was removed from 8.0. It's completely redundant and
 should just be replaced by bool (or int for anything older than c99),
 but a lot of packages use it, so we put it back in to give them more
 time to drop the usage.
